# flutter_reference

An example of a Flutter project with native bloc interop, to be used as a reference.

Set up this project as you would normally; run with `flutter run`.

When creating or editing a file that has a corresponding source file generated by freezed, regenerate with `flutter pub run build_runner build`.

## Architecture

![Architecture overview](doc/img/arq-app-flutter-hybrid-architecture-World%20Map.drawio.png)

This reference architecture uses a layered model, with a domain layer that's accessible from anywhere. It also features a method channel bridge and classes for accessing Flutter blocs from native code.

Most of the code in this app is merely provided as an example, but the structure itself follows what is presented in this documentation.

The main idea of this structure is the same as in any layered application:

- Widgets (view layer) can only use blocs (business layer) but not repositories or services directly;
- Blocs (business layer) expose their functionality to widgets and use services from the data layer to run business logic;
- The data layer is only ever used by blocs, but not by widgets directly.

Check the following pages for details on each part of the architecture:

- [Bridge](doc/bridge.md)
