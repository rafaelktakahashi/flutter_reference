/// This class uses freezed. If you don't know how to use it, read the
/// official documentation first; note that these classes reference code
/// generated by freezed, so the first time you write a class, your editor
/// will tell you that there are errors. You have to run
/// `flutter pub run build_runner build` in the terminal.
/// The important parts are: include the "part" statement at the top (you'll
/// have to write the name by hand without autocomplete the first time
/// because the file won't exist yet); add "with _Class" after the class
/// declaration, and then write a factory constructor with "= _Class" after it.
